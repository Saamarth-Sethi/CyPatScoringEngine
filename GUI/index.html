            <p style="width: 90%; text-align: center;">We recently hired a new intern named "Dan" for our banana farm to increase our productions and along with that we gave him his own laptop to keep track of production. However it seems that he has used this computer has been used for non company related purposes (video games). Please help us clean up this computer and as secure it. Just in case if Dan decided to do some monkey business with the security or password policies.</p>
